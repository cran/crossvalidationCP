Description: Implements the cross-validation methodology from Pein and Shah (2021) <arXiv:2112.03220>. Can be customised by providing different cross-validation criteria, estimators for the change-point locations and local parameters, and freely chosen folds. Pre-implemented estimators and criteria are available. It also includes our own implementation of the COPPS procedure <doi:10.1214/19-AOS1814>.
